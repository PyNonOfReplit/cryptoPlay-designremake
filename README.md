## What is CryptoPlay?
CryptoPlay is a cryptocurrency simulator, i.e. you don't trade or mine cryptocurrencies here, you only buy and sell them in an imaginary simulation. We use real-time values obtained from CoinGecko, so you can actually learn the trend of the cryptocurrency market. You can find CryptoPlay [here](https://todofy.live)
## Who developed CryptoPlay
CryptoPlay has many contributors, but the main ones are @Adnan-Jindani, the creator, @pogrushan, a backend engineer and @PyNonOfReplit, a website designer. We also have readme contributions from @ankitrajrj.
## How to use
Using CryptoPlay is as simple as your average website. You login or signup and once you get redirected to the main page, well, you have all the freedom you want with the million imaginary 'vcoins' or 'virtual coins'. You can buy or sell 4 main cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin and Solana).
